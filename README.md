# Python Learning - Day 1

Welcome to Day 1 of my Python learning journey!  
I'm starting from the basics, and today I practiced working with:

- `if` statements
- `elif` conditions
- `else` logic

### ðŸ§  What I Learned
Control flow in Python is the foundation of decision-making in code.  
Learning to handle different conditions using `if`, `elif`, and `else` is my first step in solving real-world problems with Python.

### ðŸ“‚ Files
- `day1_if_elif.py`: Simple examples of conditional logic
